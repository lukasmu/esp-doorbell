# Make a smart doorbell using the ESP32

This repository contains the code for making an ESP32-based doorbell that initiates a SIP call. While the code currently only initiates a SIP call and thus makes your phone(s)ring, it might be extended in the future to also provide intercom functionalities.

Take a look at the [Heise article](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2018/17/1534215254552977) and the [Reichelt article](https://www.reichelt.de/magazin/how-to/smarte-tuerklingel/) to get started.  Additionally, the [mikrocontroller.net thread](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/442157) might be useful.
These articles serve as foundation for this project. But of course there are some differences:
- This project uses an ESP32 instead of an ESP8266.
- This project does not reset the ESP32 every time someone rings the bell. Instead a GPIO pin is used for waking up the ESP32 from deep sleep. This ensures that the ESP32 will not be reset continuously if someone keeps ringing the doorbell.
- This project does not make use of the TR-064 protocol but instead of the SIP protocol.
- The code is optimized for ease of use (it requires only minimal and non-sensitive config) and performance (it buffers the WiFi settings so that connecting to the WiFi is fast).

## Tips & Tricks

Here are some tips that might be handy:
- In your router you only need to setup a new IP phone and obtain the credentials.
- Create the [esp-doorbell-config.h](esp-doorbell/esp-doorbell-config.h) file based on the [esp-doorbell-config.h.example](esp-doorbell/esp-doorbell-config.h.example) file and add your credentials in there.
- Depending on the lenght of the wire to your door bell button, you might want to use a different resistance/LED to ensure that the optocoupler works properly (especially if you use only a low supply voltage).
- Make sure to add the [ESP32 board manager](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json) and install the [TR-064-SOAP-Library](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library) in the Arduino IDE.
